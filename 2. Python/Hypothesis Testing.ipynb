    "\n",
    "1. Compute test statistic\n",

    "### Key Terminologies\n",
    "- __Confidence Interval__: it is the range of likely values for a population parameter, such as the population mean. For example, if you compute a 95% confidence interval for the average price of a product, then you can be 95% confident that the interval contains the true average cost of all of the product.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Null Hyothesis__: the hypothesis that there is no significant difference between specified populations, any observed difference being due to sampling or experimental error.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Confidence Level__: the probability which a researcher sets prior to conducting the experiement with which he is confident of null hypothesis to be true.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Alternate Hypothesis__: contrary to the null hypothesis. It is usually taken to be that the observations are the result of a real effect (with some amount of chance variation superposed).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __p value__: the probability of obtaining your sample data, if the null hypothesis were true.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Alpha value__: it is the probability of making a wrong decision. Rejecting the Null Hypothesis when it is true.\n",
